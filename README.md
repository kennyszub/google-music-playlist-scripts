Google Music Playlist Scripts
=============================

Some quick scripts for editing Google Music playlists.

Uses the unofficial Google Music Api by [simon weber](https://github.com/simon-weber).

## Usage

### Install [Unofficial Google Music Api](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API)

### Change login credentials
* You must change the login credentials in both scripts for them to work. Change 'username' and 'password' to your Google Music credentials.

### delete_dups_from_playlists
* This script deletes the duplicate songs from within each individual playlist. The tracks must be identical (ie. the same track id and song file) to be deleted.

### add_last_songs_to_top_of_playlist
* This script provides a way to move the last N songs of a playlist to be the first N songs. Run it without arguments to see the usage.

### Warning
* Neither script prompts you before making changes to your playlists.
